# 📝 Backend Developer Take-Home Challenge

This is a complete implementation of the **Notes CRUD API** as described in the [Global Innovation take-home challenge](https://bitbucket.org/global_innovation/take-home-challenge/src/main/).

It includes:

* ✅ A RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express**
* ✅ A simple **in-memory data store** (no database)
* ✅ A **React + Material UI frontend** to interact with the API
* ✅ Logging and basic error handling
* ✅ A demonstration video with explanation

### ✅ API Endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint         | Description         |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/notes`     | Create a new note   |
| GET    | `/api/notes`     | Retrieve all notes  |

| PUT    | `/api/notes/:id` | Update a note by ID |
